## Description 📝

This web application allows users to create custom AI generated artwork using the impressive DALLE-2 API by OpenAI. The generated image is automatically shared as a public post. The user can view it, change it to private, edit the description, download the image or delete the post. User accounts are limited to 5 generations per day. Users can also use the upload form to share a generation from a different site (example, stable diffusion). The site also has an About section which is managed from the sites admin panel, this allows admins to alter and create additional pages as required.

## Planning & Wireframes

I created the following wireframe sketches prior to creating the project. I wanted a clean, simple, user-friendly layout for the site. 

<details> <summary>Home Page Plan</summary> <img src="readme_images/setup/homePlan.jpg" style="max-width: 66%;"> </details>

<details> <summary>Post Page Plan</summary> <img src="readme_images/setup/postPlan.jpg" style="max-width: 66%;"> </details>

My initial goal was to set up a site that allows users to post generations from other resources then to implement additional features such as the AI Art Generations if I had time.

## Deployment (Prior to Completing Project) 🚀

### Step 1: Setting up the Django Project 🛠️ 1️⃣

**On Gipod:**

- Enter the following Terminal Commands:

        pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn  # This installs the latest version of Django, lower than version 4. It also installs the Gunicorn web server.
        pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2  # This installs DJ Database, a package to utilise URL database and Pyscopg2, a PostgreSQL adapter for Python to communicate with the database.
        pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage  # This installs Cloudinary.
        pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt  # This saves the requirments to a txt file.
        django-admin startproject ai_art .  # This is the project name.
        python3 manage.py startapp art_gallery  # This is the app name.

- Add the app name to the settings.py file and save:

        INSTALLED_APPS = [..., 'art_gallery', ...]

- Enter the following Terminal Command:

        python3 manage.py migrate  # This migrates the changes.
        python3 manage.py runserver  # This runs the server, test it works.

### Step 2: Deploying App to Heroku 🚀 2️⃣

**On ElephantSQL:**

- Create account / login
- Create a new instance
- Set up plan: Select name, Select Tiny Turtle Free Plan and leave Tags blank
- Select Region (Europe)
- Review and create instance
- Return to dashboard and select the instance
- Copy the ElephantSQL database URL

**On Heroku:** 

- Create account / login
- Create new app
- Open settings tab and reveal config vars
- Add a config var called `DATABASE_URL` and paste the ElephantSQL database URL as the value

**On Gitpod:**

- Create a env.py file in the top level directory and add the following: 

        import os
        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<ElephantSQL Database URL>"
        os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<YourOwnRandomSecretKey>"

**On Heroku:**

- Add the above SECRET_KEY (YourOwnRandomSecretKey) to the config vars

**On Gitpod, in the settings.py file:**

- Add the following: 

        from pathlib import Path
        import os
        import dj_database_url

        if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
        import env

- Remove the insecure secret key and replace with following to link to the SECRET_KEY variable:

        SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

- Comment out or remove the database section:

        # DATABASES = {
        #     'default': {
        #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        #         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        #     }
        # }

- Add new Databases section to link to the DATABASE_URL: 

        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
        }

**On Gitpod, in the terminal:**

- Save and then migrate files: 

        python3 manage.py migrate

**On Cloudinary:**

- Create account / login
- Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL from the dashboard

**On Gitpod:**

- Add the CLOUDINARY_URL to the env.py file:

        os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"

**On Heroku:**

- Add "CLOUDINARY_URL" to Heroku Config Vars using your cloudinary URL
- Add "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC" to confiv vars with a value of "1"

**On Gitpod, in settings.py:**

- Add the Cloudinary Libraries to INSTALLED_APPS (note, order is important):

        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            …,
            'cloudinary_storage',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'cloudinary',
            …,
        ]

- Add the following under Static Files to tell Django to use Cloudinary to store static media and files: 

        STATIC_URL = '/static/'

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
        STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

        MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'

- Link file to the templates directory in Heroku, place under the BASE_DIR line:

        TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR, place within the TEMPLATES array:

        TEMPLATES = [
            {
                …,
                'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
            …,
                    ],
                },
            },
        ]

- Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS (ex: "HEROKU-PROJECT-NAME.herokuapp.com"):

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["ai-art-site.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]

**On Gitpod:**

- Add 3 new folders in top level directory: media, static, templates
- Create a "Procfile" in the top level directory and add the following code (ai_art is the Django Project Name):

        web: gunicorn ai_art.wsgi

- In the terminal, add commit and push:

        git add .
        git commit -m “Deployment Commit”
        git push

**On Heroku:**

- Deploy content manually, I used the GitHub deployment method on main branch.

## Final Deployment (Post Completion of Project) 🚀

### Final Deployment to Heroku

**On Gitpod:**
- Within `settings.py`, ensure the `'DEBUG'` value is set to `'False'`.
- Remove `'DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC'` from `settings.py` to ensure static files are collected correctly.

**On Heroku:** 

- Remove `'DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC'` from the config vars.
- Trigger a manual deployment in the Deployment Section for the project.

### Custom Web Domain & SSL 💻 🌐

**On Gitpod:**

- Add the custom domain name to ALLOWED_HOSTS (ex: "custom-domain.com"):

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = [... "cre8ai.art", ".cre8ai.art", "www.cre8ai.art" ...]

- Migrate changes as per previous
- Git add, commit and push changes

**On Heroku:**

- Deploy manually

**On Namecheap (or alternative Domain Registrar):**

- Set up account / login
- Select suitable domain name and purchase (for reference, this domain cost about 3 euro)

**On Heroku:**

- Link to the custom domain
- Set up authorisation token

**On Gitpod:**

- In the terminal login to Heroku by entering the following: 
        heroku login -i
- Enter your Heroku Login details and use the heroku authorisation token as the password - your heroku password or code from authenticaor will not work.

**On NameCheap:**

- Configure the custom domain using Advanced DNS settings:
  - Set up the CNAME and URL Redirect.

**On DNSChecker:**

- Search domain name on [DNS Checker (.org)](https://dnschecker.org/#A/cre8ai.art) to see if it has propegated (this can take 24 to 48 hours).

**On Cloudflare:** 

<details> 
<summary>SSL certs are free on the Standard Heroku Domain but both Heroku and Namecheap charge for SSL certification for custom domains so I set it up for free with Clourflare.</summary> 
<img src="readme_images/setup/namecheapSSLPrices.png" style="max-width: 66%;">
</details>

- Set up free account
- Link to website
- Set up redirect to HTTPS to ensure secure connection

## Bugs 🐛 🐌 🕷️

### Resolved Bugs ✅ 🐞

| Bug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| HTML code being displayed on the post previews | I used the striptags filter to remove the code tags |
| Post titles and slugs too long | I set up truncating to reduce the length. |
| Posts with same prompt generation not working | I set up a function to make each title and slug unique by adding a number to the end and incrimating by 1. |
| Site went down and stopped working after deployment | This issue arose after setting up the custom domain but appeared to be unrelated to these changes. After investigating, it turned out the issue was caused by a blank post that did not have a slug, despite numerous tests, I was unable to recreate another Post without a Slug or Title. I rectified the issue by adding a filter to the index template to remove posts without slugs from being displayed which allowed the site to load but it showed an empty post on the index page, I then deleted the empty post via the admin panel. I carried out numerous tests to recreate the issue but was unable to. If an empty post was somehow raised again, it would not cause the same issue. |
| Unable to create image generation with the same prompt as previously used | I adapted the code to add a number to the end of the public id, slug and title to ensure the values are unique, its then replaced and increases by one. |
| LoginRequiredMixin wasn't working | To seolve the issue, I moved the LoginRequiredMixin to the leftmost position of each the class function inheritance lists where it was implemented. |
| Console Problem: Line too long errors | I resolved these by splitting or reducing the length of comments for each line too long error. |
| Console Problems: Trailing white spaces and too many / too little blank lines | I refactored these issues accordingly. |
| Browser Console Problem on Posts and User Pages (when not the creator of the post / profile user): "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')" | I resolved this issue by adding if statements before the JS code to check the element exists |

### Outstanding Bugs ❌ 🤔

| Bug | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| When the user generates an image with the same prompt as an image generated prior to May, it may dispay the previous generated image on the users post instead of the newly generated images | This issue arose after I made adjustments to the Cloudinary Public Image IDs, this issue does not occur with duplicated generations where the orginal was created in May or after so I have left the bug present for now until I have more time to resolve. |

## Future Development 💭 💡

I would have liked to implement some of the below features but was unable to due to timing restraints, the following could be planned for development at a later stage:

- Set up additional sign up information as a requirement, such as email address, etc. 

- Set up password resets for user

- Set up print on demand products below each of the posts and payment processing for same

- Set up user private messaging system

- Set up comments section on user profiles

- Set up pagination on user profiles

- Set up a "Following" section and allow users to follow other creators

- Set up social sign up and login

- Set up a social share feature that allows users to share their generations easily on social media

- Set up automatic likes for users own posts

- Set up advertising on the site to generate revenue

- Set up subscription tiers: Free, Paid Plan and Supreme Plan. Restrict daily generations based on tier and amount of adverts displayed etc.

- Set up additional site analytics on the admin panel

- Improve on the search feature, for example, if you search "car" it will also show results for "cartoon" but it will not show keyword with car models like "Lamborghini"

- Set up social media accounts

- Set up a prompt generator using ChatGPT API. The user will be asked a series of questions, ChatGPT will use the users input to create a more detailed text prompt that would then be passed through the the DALLE API to create the image, this will help the user create more detailed prompts for the text to art generations instead of simple user inputs like "A painting of a sunset". Example of detailed prompt below: 
    - "Create a surrealistic artwork of a futuristic cityscape with flying cars and neon lights. The city should be situated on a giant floating platform that hovers over an endless abyss. In the foreground, there should be a mysterious figure wearing a hooded cloak, holding a glowing orb. The overall aesthetic should be cyberpunk with a touch of magic and mystery. The artwork should be bold and dynamic, with a strong use of contrasting colors and dramatic lighting. Let your imagination run wild and create a stunning visual representation of this futuristic world."

- Consider changing the admin static about pages from HTML to a standard text entry format so that the admins will not need to enter the data using any code.

- I briefly set up a function to generate keywords automatically for each of the generated images using GPT3 (OpenAI) but decided not to implement this feature to keep API charges to a minimum, this could be added back in future.

- I chose not to add a watermark to the generated images but this could be added in future.

## Summary of Charges

As mentioned above, I have avoided subscriptions and costs where possible. I have spent less than 5 euro creating this project as most of the third party tecnologies used in this project are on free accounts (eg. Cloudflare, The Heroku Dyno, Cloudinary, ElephantSQL, etc) however the following items are charged for: 

- **OpenAI API Calls** - The only OpenAI model used for this project is DALLE 2, each API call (at the time of writing) is charged at 2 cent. OpenAI comes with 20 dollars free credits which expire after 3 months, the free credits will cover 1,000 image generations (a few months ago it was 60cent per generation).

- **NameCheap Domain Registration** - The total price for the domain, including privacy, was $3.88 for the first year.

**Note:** the free accounts may come with limitations which may need to be monitored, example, cloudinary provides 25 credits per month, after 100s of image generations, I have only used the following: `Credit Usage For Last 30 Days = 1.61 of 25 (6.44% used)`

## Credits 👏 🙌

I would like to give credit to the all of the content creators and developers of the above documentation and listed resources. In addition to this, I would like to give a lot of credit to the following resources: 

- **Code Institute** - I've been learning how to code through the Code Institute, I found the information learned so far has given me the ability to create most of this project, I found the walk through Django Blog Project very helpful and it was used as the base for this project and expanded on from there. The Django "cheat sheet for deployment" was also really useful for the deployment stages, most of which has been reiteratted in the Deployment section above.

- **CI Mentor** - I found my three calls with my Code Institute mentor, Rohit, exceptionally valuable and useful.

- **ChatGPT** - ChatGPT is relativly new technolgoy and needs to be used with a **mountain** of salt. Despite its inaccuracies, hallecanations and limitations, I found it a very useful resource when creating this project. I used it to assist with debugging and to point me in the direction of some of the coding requirements. It was particularliy useful when configuring the GenerateArt View, this took some trial and error before I had it functioning as intended. I also used ChatGPT to create the boilerplate data for the static about pages. I cross checked any information provided by ChatGPT with reputable resources to ensure the data being provided is reliable and accurate. I used ChatGPT to create the table for the libraries used above.

- **YouTube** - I watched many videos on how to set up and use the OpenAI API, create Django projects, configure custom domains, set up free SSL cert, set up free custom email domains, etc, most of which have been listed above. I enjoy visual learning and find watching tutorials very useful.
